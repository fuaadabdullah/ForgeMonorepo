"""Compatibility shim: allow imports like `backend.services...` when tests are
executed with the current working directory set to the `backend/` folder.

When pytest is run from inside `backend/`, importing `backend.` fails because
the importer looks for a *backend* package inside the current directory.
This module makes the `backend` module act like a package by exposing a
`__path__` pointing at the package directory so submodules (e.g. `services`)
can be imported as `backend.services.*`.

This file is a harmless local compatibility shim and does not change
normal import behavior when the project root is on PYTHONPATH.
